This is a framework for making bots compete against each other in a number of games.

The first game is a classic prisonner's dilema. 3 trivial bots are given in example.

Usage
=====

    python arena/arena.py

Then go to http://localhost:8080/arena with your webbrowser and run games.

To create a bot, make a subdirectory in bots/ and follow the instructions in doc/protocol and add it in the list named 'bots' at the begining of arena.py

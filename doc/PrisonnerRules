Bots must use stdin and stdout as communication channels. 
    In Python, that means outputing with print, inputing with raw_input()
    In C++, that means using cout and cin

Bots must use these channels without buffering<
    In python, you can do that by either flushing stdout after each print or starting the interpreter with the -u flag

Bots must print "OK" after initializing then wait for an input.
If the input is "A", the bot must play the first round.

Subsequent input will be in the form "T 15 26"
    The first character is the last choice of the opponent
    The second number is the current score of the bot
    The third number is the sum of the scores

A bot must output a single character and a new line ("\n") at each round. The character is "C" for "cooperate" and "T" for "betray"
An input of "Q" indicates that the run is finished and the bot must exit.

Bots must be in their own subdirectory in the directory bots/
Their directory must contain an executable file named 'start', launching the bot.

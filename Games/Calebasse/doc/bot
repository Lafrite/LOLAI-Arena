=========

Once the bot is initialised (which means that it have sent "OK\n", the game will send him an id (to recognise himself).

The game will send "{b1:__, b2:__, ...}\n" the dictionnary of fund that each players have. Then it will wait for the bet of players.
Players send their bet: "bet\n". The game send whether or not the bet is accepted:
    - "Accepted\n" : if it is
    - "Rejected\n" : if it isn't. Then the player will have to send his bet again.
The game send the bet of everybody "bets: {b1:__, b2:__, ...}
It send then the winner.
